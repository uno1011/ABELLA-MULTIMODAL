  <p class="info">World hunger affects over <span style = "color:red;">800 million people</span> worldwide, leaving families without enough food to survive or thrive. It deepens poverty, weakens communities, and hits children the hardest, yet hunger is entirely preventable, and ending it is within our reach. Through your generosity, we can provide meals, support local farmers, and build lasting change so every family has a chance to live with dignity, strength, and hope.  <p>

      <h2>WHY DOES THIS HAPPEN?</h2>
      <p>
        poverty and low income limit families’ ability to buy food. Natural disasters such as typhoons and floods destroy crops and livelihoods. Rising food prices make staples unaffordable. And many areas, especially rural regions, have limited access to nutritious food.
